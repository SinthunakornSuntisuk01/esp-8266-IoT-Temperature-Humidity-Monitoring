This project was developed for monitoring real time temperature and relative humidity over the internet by using Thingspeak. On top of that, the device is integrated with an OLED display for 
for more convenient monitoring of the temperature and relative humidity values. The device was installed in the IR spectrophotometer instrument room at my department for monitoring  the temperature
and relative humidity values 24/7. The reason why i develop this device because the IR spectrophotometer of my department is often have a problem moisture. When we analyzed the sample, 
there was always the peak of water interfearance appearing in the sample, which caused by the moisture in the air. The ideal the optimal temeperature and realtive humidity for operate 
the IR spectrophotometer should be lower than 30 °C and 60% respectvely. So want to know temperature and relative humidity value in the instrument room 24/7 for collect the data
and writing the report to improve the maintanance procedure IR spectrophotometer of my department. for those who are interest and having the same or similar problem you can feel free to use 
or modified this project as you like ／人◕ ‿‿ ◕人＼
